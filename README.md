I'm trying to create my own personalized virtual AI assistant to learn and because it's cool lmao:)

Main points:
- IMPORTANT! I want to create an actual AI, with it's information retrieval algorithms, machine learning, etc. Not just a fixed voice command bot.
- IMPORTANT! I want to understand what I do. Mainly the math implied. I don't want to just copy code blindly hell nah
- implement it into a raspberry pi 5 that I got for christmas to run uninterruptedly and be my mate
- AI voice chatbot (similar to JARVIS u know) that can look information for me and be actually usefull
- control IOT devices I'm making with ESP32s
